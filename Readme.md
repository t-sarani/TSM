# Playing With Text Data Competition

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed by my team and I for the 'Playing With Text Data' competition organized by the Statistics Association of the University of Neyshabur. Our participation was a great learning experience, and while we didn't secure the first position, we are proud of our accomplishments and the skills we developed during the process.

## Competition Details
- **Questions**: The competition consisted of two main questions provided in the files [`Khayyam_Question.html`](Khayyam_Question.html) (Q1) and [`Main_Question.html`](Main_Question.html) (Q2).
- **Scoring**: Q1 is worth 20 marks and Q2 is worth 80 marks.

### Achievements
- **Q1**: I successfully coded an algorithm that identified the occurrences of the name "Omar Khayyam" and achieved a count of **12**. However, the actual count is **13**.
- **Q2**: Additional improvements and solutions are encouraged. I invite others to join me in exploring further enhancements and data analysis with the provided datasets.

## Collaborative Invitation
I invite fellow participants and data enthusiasts to collaborate on refining our solutions to the second question, as well as exploring additional data-driven projects based on the competition data. Together, we can enhance our coding skills and share insights.

### Code Contributions
The repository includes a file named [`new.code`](new.code), which contains my implementation that draws from the programming efforts of international participants. Collaborative contributions are welcome!
